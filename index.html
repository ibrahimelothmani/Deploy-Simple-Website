      <h3><strong>I'm Ibrahim El Othmani a Cloud & DevOps Engineer</strong></h3>
      <p>
        DevOps/Cloud Engineer with a unique background: Civil Engineering degree
        (2020) → Career transition to tech → Professional training at 2i
        Formation (2023-2024). I completed a DevOps internship at IBH Ibn
        Alhaytham (Aug-Oct 2024) and now work as a freelance DevOps engineer
        serving international clients. I specialize in Kubernetes orchestration,
        multi-cloud architecture (AWS, Azure), and Infrastructure as Code. My
        toolkit includes Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Jenkins, and
        Prometheus/Grafana for building automated, scalable infrastructure
        solutions. From designing bridges in civil engineering to building
        bridges between development and operations, my mission is to automate
        infrastructure, enable continuous delivery, and help teams ship faster
        with confidence. Currently seeking full-time DevOps/Cloud opportunities
        where I can contribute to scaling cloud-native systems.
